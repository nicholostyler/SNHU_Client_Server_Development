# How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

The way that you write programs that are maintainable is that you leave comments that describe what exactly your code does. This includes commenting on functions that explain what their parameters are used for and what they their return type is. To write a program that is readable, you need to keep code at a good length and not use cryptic writing. This allows for people to understand your code and goes together with writing comments. To write code that is adaptable you need to practice encapsulation and break up your code into methods and even other files. This means that when I separated the logic in a crud.py file, it allowed me to separate the code logic from my view.

# How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?

One way that I approach a problem as a computer scientist is you must read exactly what the client is requesting and see what can and cannot be done. The approach I took for this project was different from other projects because there were a lot more variables that I had to account for. For instance, I had to think about how the interface was going to be designed and user friendly for the customer, and I had to use techniques to keep the database easy to use from a development standpoint. 

# What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?

Computer scientists see the power and utility that comes with computer programs. They can mold a program into a tool that businesses use on a daily basis to get work done. Computer Scientists utilize apis and programming to solve real world problems using algorithms and logic.
